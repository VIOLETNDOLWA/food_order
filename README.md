# food_order
Functional website with both frontend and backend
sides. On the frontend side, the user can search for the food based
on the category, order the food then he/she will be directed to
another page where the user can increase the quantity of the food,
use his/her credentials to fill the form then order the food.
On the backend side, it allows the admin to log in admin
dashboard where he/she can be able to add food-based on
category, update or delete food, upload images and view the status
of the user i.e who has ordered, delivered, or canceled both in
dashboard and database.
